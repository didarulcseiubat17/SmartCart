Familiar with

queues?

We all are.


### The problem

```
Since the birth of the shopping mall itself, we, as
consumers have despised standing in long lines,
waiting for cashier to check our products out.
```
#### 1


# “

In one industry study, 58 percent of

respondents reported that being on

hold made them feel frustrated. This

frustration often manifests itself in a

lack of patience.


### The idea

How about cashless and

counterless shopping

centres? Imagine a customer

walking in, picking up what

they like and being free to

leave?

###### 


##### Implementation

```
◇ We have built an app which does the billing for us.
◇ The app allows the user to scan the product QR
codes, finalize the items in their virtual cart and pay
accordingly.
```
It aims to create smart stores which will improve in-store
shopping experience.

##### Our process is

##### easy

```
pick scan pay
```

##### Working

**Account**

The user needs to first
sign up with a valid
phone number. Once an
account is created, they
can use it every time
they shop.

```
Selection
Whenever the users
add some item to their
carts, they scan it so
that it appears in the
virtual carts as well.
```
```
Check-out
After finalizing the
items, he/she can simply
click pay and the money
is deducted from their
wallets and paid to the
mall.
```

##### Implementation

```
Database
The project is powered by MySQL
database on its backend.
```
```
Languages
Java is used for functionalities
and PHP is used to establish
connection with the database.
XML represents the front end.
```
```
Technologies
Zxing is used for QR functionality.
Picasso is for image retrieval from
the database. OkHttp for retrieval
from web.
```
```
Model
In Iterative Development Model
the delivery of software is divided
into increments or builds with
each increment adding new
functionality to the software
product.
```
```
Requirements
The only requirement is an
android powered mobile running
on a 4.1.2 version or higher with a
minimum API level of 16.
Therefore, compatible with 99.2%
of total devices.
```
```
Hosting
The MySQL database, images
and PHP is stored online. Thanks
to 000webhost for their free
services.
```

Impact

```
Not only does this save the consumer’s
time but also any shop owner would be
more than happy to have this system as
they do not need to hire cashiers anymore.
That saves a lot of capital on the billing
process. This system can be better utilized
to provide the consumer with better service
and more perks for shopping.
```

## Thanks!
